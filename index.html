  <div class="message-box" id="breatheMsg">
    Sometimes all you need is a single breath to start feeling a little lighter.  
    So right now, close your eyes for a second — inhale deeply, hold it, and slowly let go.  
    You don’t have to fix everything today. You don’t need to be strong all the time.  
    You just need to be here, breathing, existing — and that’s already more than enough. 💗  
    <br><br>
    The world can be too loud sometimes, but you don’t have to carry all that noise in your heart.  
    Just breathe. You deserve peace, even in small moments like this. 🌸
  </div>

  <div class="message-box" id="heartMsg">
    I know your heart feels heavy. I know you’re trying to make sense of things that still hurt.  
    But please, don’t close yourself off from love — especially your own.  
    You have such a warm, gentle heart, even if it’s been bruised.  
    Let it rest, let it heal, and when you’re ready, open it again.  
    The world still has so much beauty waiting for you, and so many people who care. 🌷  
    <br><br>
    You’ve always had this quiet strength — the kind that doesn’t shout, but endures.  
    One day, you’ll look back and realize how much you’ve grown through the pain. 💞
  </div>

  <div class="message-box" id="comfortMsg">
    I want you to know something: even when I don’t say the right words, I still care deeply.  
    Sometimes I stay quiet — not because I don’t want to comfort you,  
    but because I’m scared I’ll say something that won’t help at all.  
    I wish I could take away your pain, or at least hold it with you.  
    I may not always have the perfect words, but my heart is always with you — quietly hoping you find peace again. 🤍  
    <br><br>
    You don’t have to go through this alone.  
    Even if all I can offer is silence, I promise it’s a silence that listens, that stays, and that cares. 🌼
